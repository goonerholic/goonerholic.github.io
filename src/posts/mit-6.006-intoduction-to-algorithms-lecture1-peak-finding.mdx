# Lecture 1: Peak Finding

## One-dimensional Version

**Definition of a peak**: Given array `A`, index `A[n]` is a peak **if** and **only if** `A[n] > A[n - 1]` and `A[n] > A[n + 1]`

**Problem**: Find a peak **if it exists**

### Straightforward Algorithm

Start from left to the end, find the peak by definition.

In worst case, runtime complexity would be **θ(n).**

### Better Idea

> Divide and Conquer

Given an array `A`:

```
a = [1, 2, ..., n / 2 - 1, n / 2, n / 2 + 1, ..., n - 1, n]
```

Look at `n / 2` position:

```
if a[n / 2] < a[n / 2 - 1]:
	// only look at left half to look for a peak
    [1, ..., n / 2 - 1]
else if a[n / 2] < a[n / 2 + 1]:
	// only look at right half to look for a peak
	[n / 2 + 1, ..., n]
else:
	a[n / 2] is a peak
```

### What is the complexity?

if `T(n)` denotes work required to solve problem with `n` elements,
```
T(n) = T(n / 2) + θ(1) = θ(1) * lb(n) = θ(lb(n))
```
*T: The amount of work to solve the problem
**lb: Binary logarithm

## Two-dimensional Version

**Definition**: Given two-dimensional array `A` which has `n` rows and `m` columns, `A[i][j]` is a peak, if,
```
A[i][j] >= A[i][j - 1] and
A[i][j] >= A[i][j + 1] and
A[i][j] >= A[i - 1][j] and
A[i][j] >= A[i + 1][j]
```

### Attemp #1: Extend 1-D Divide and Conquer to 2-D
- first, pick middle column `j = m / 2`.
- And then, find a 1-D peak at `(i, j)`.
- Use `(i, j)` as a start point on row `i` to find 1-D peak on row `i`.

**But it's not working!.** 2-D peak may not exist on row `i`.

### Attemp #2
- Pick middle column `j = m / 2`.(Again)
- Find global maximum on column `j` at `(i, j)`.
- Compare `(i, j - 1)`, `(i, j)`, `(i, j + 1)`.
- Pick left columns of `(i, j - 1)` > `(i, j)`.
- Similary for right.
- `(i, j)` is a 2-D peak if neither condition holds.
- Solve the new problem with half the number of columns.
- When you have a single column, find global maximum and you are done.

### Complexity of Attemp #2
if `T(n, n)` denotes work required to solve problem with `n` rows and `m` columns:
```
T(n, m) = T(n, m / 2) + θ(n)
        = θ(n) + ... + θ(n)
        = θ(nlog(m)) = θ(nlog(n)) if m = n
